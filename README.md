common shared code for Microservices

A question most of the people asked is if there can be common code between services. The answer is a qualified 'Yes'. The bottom line is that you version common code and treat it the same way as you treat third-party products like Hibernate or Apache commons Lang. Individual services decide when/if to upgrade. 

Changes or enhancemnets to common code cannot force deplyments of multiple services. Finally Common code should be versioned just like any third-party library you use.
